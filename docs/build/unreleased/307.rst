    Added "post write hooks" to revision generation.  These allow custom logic
    to run after a revision Python script is generated, typically for the
    purpose of running code formatters such as "Black" or "autopep8", but may
    be used for any arbitrary post-render hook as well, including custom Python
    functions or scripts.  The hooks are enabled by providing a
    ``[post_write_hooks]`` section in the alembic.ini file.  A single hook
    is provided which runs an arbitrary Python executable on the newly
    generated revision script, which can be configured to run code formatters
    such as Black; full examples are included in the documentation.
