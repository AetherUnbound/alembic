    The "alembic init" command will now proceed if the target directory exists
    as long as it's still empty.  Previously, it would not proceed if the
    directory existed. The new behavior is modeled from what git does, to
    accommodate for container or other deployments where an Alembic target
    directory may need to be already mounted instead of being created with
    alembic init.  Pull request courtesy Aviskar KC.
