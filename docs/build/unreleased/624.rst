    Added support for rendering of "computed" elements on :class:`.Column`
    objects, supported in SQLAlchemy via the new :class:`.Computed` element
    introduced in version 1.3.11. Pull request courtesy Federico Caselli.

    Note that there is currently no support for ALTER COLUMN to add, remove, or
    modify the "GENERATED ALWAYS AS" element from a column;  at least for
    PostgreSQL, it does not seem to be supported by the database. Additionally,
    SQLAlchemy does not currently reliably reflect the "GENERATED ALWAYS AS"
    phrase from an existing column, so there is also no autogenerate support
    for addition or removal of the :class:`.Computed` element to or from an
    existing column, there is only support for adding new columns that include
    the :class:`.Computed` element.  In the case that the :class:`.Computed`
    element is removed from the :class:`.Column` object in the table metadata,
    PostgreSQL and Oracle currently reflect the "GENERATED ALWAYS AS"
    expression as the "server default" which will produce an op that tries to
    drop the element as a default.
