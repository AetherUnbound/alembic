    Fixed regression caused by the new "type comparison" logic introduced in
    1.4 as part of :ticket:`605` where comparisons of MySQL "unsigned integer"
    datatypes would produce false positives, as the regular expression logic
    was not correctly parsing the "unsigned" token when MySQL's default display
    width would be returned by the database.  Pull request courtesy Paul
    Becotte.
