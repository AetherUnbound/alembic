    Improved the Python rendering of a series of migration operations such that
    a single "pass" is rendered for a :class:`.UpgradeOps` or
    :class:`.DowngradeOps` based on if no lines of Python code actually
    rendered under the operation, rather than whether or not sub-directives
    exist. Removed extra "pass" lines that would generate from the
    :class:`.ModifyTableOps` directive so that these aren't duplicated under
    operation rewriting scenarios.
