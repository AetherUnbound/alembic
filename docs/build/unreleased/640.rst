    :tags: feature, batch
    :tickets: 640

    Added new parameters :paramref:`.BatchOperations.add_column.insert_before`,
    :paramref:`.BatchOperations.add_column.insert_after` which provide for
    establishing the specific position in which a new column should be placed.
    Also added :paramref:`.Operations.batch_alter_table.partial_reordering`
    which allows the complete set of columns to be reordered when the new table
    is created.   Both operations apply only to when batch mode is recreating
    the whole table using ``recreate="always"``.  Thanks to Marcin Szymanski
    for assistance with the implementation.
