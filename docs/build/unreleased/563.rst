    Replaced the Python compatbility routines for ``getargspec()`` with a fully
    vendored version based on ``getfullargspec()`` from Python 3.3.
    Originally, Python was emitting deprecation warnings for this function in
    Python 3.8 alphas.  While this change was reverted, it was observed that
    Python 3 implementations for ``getfullargspec()`` are an order of magnitude
    slower as of the 3.4 series where it was rewritten against ``Signature``.
    While Python plans to improve upon this situation, SQLAlchemy projects for
    now are using a simple replacement to avoid any future issues.
