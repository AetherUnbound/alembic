    Fixed issue where MySQL databases need to use CHANGE COLUMN when altering a
    server default of CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, NOW() and probably other functions
    that are only usable with DATETIME/TIMESTAMP columns.  While MariaDB
    supports both CHANGE and ALTER COLUMN in this case, MySQL databases only
    support CHANGE.  So the new logic is that if the server default change is
    against a DateTime-oriented column, the CHANGE format is used
    unconditionally, as in the vast majority of cases the server default is to
    be CURRENT_TIMESTAMP which may also be potentially bundled with an "ON
    UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP" directive, which SQLAlchemy does not currently
    support as a distinct field.  The fix addiionally improves the server
    default comparison logic when the "ON UPDATE" clause is present and
    there are parenthesis to be adjusted for as is the case on some MariaDB
    versions.
