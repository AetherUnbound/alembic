    Added new feature :meth:`.MigrationContext.autocommit_block`, a special
    directive which will provide for a non-transactional block inside of a
    migration script. The feature requres that: the database driver
    (e.g. DBAPI) supports the AUTOCOMMIT isolation mode.  The directive
    also necessarily needs to COMMIT the existing transaction in progress
    in order to enter autocommit mode.
