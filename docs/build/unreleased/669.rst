    :tickets: 669

    Adjusted autogen comparison to accommodate for backends that support
    computed column reflection, dependent on SQLAlchemy version 1.3.16 or
    higher. This emits a warning if the SQL expression inside of a
    :class:`.Computed` value changes between the metadata and the database, as
    these expressions can't be changed without dropping and recreating the
    column.
