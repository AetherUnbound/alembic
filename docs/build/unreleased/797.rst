    Added new config file option ``prepend_sys_path``, which is a series of
    paths that will be prepended to sys.path; the default value in newly
    generated alembic.ini files is ".".  This fixes a long-standing issue
    where for some reason running the alembic command line would not place the
    local "." path in sys.path, meaning an application locally present in "."
    and importable through normal channels, e.g. python interpreter, pytest,
    etc. would not be located by Alembic, even though the ``env.py`` file is
    loaded relative to the current path when ``alembic.ini`` contains a
    relative path. To enable for existing installations, add the option to the
    alembic.ini file as follows::

      # sys.path path, will be prepended to sys.path if present.
      # defaults to the current working directory.
      prepend_sys_path = .

    .. seealso::

        :ref:`installation` - updated documentation reflecting that local
        installation of the project is not necessary if running the Alembic cli
        from the local path.
