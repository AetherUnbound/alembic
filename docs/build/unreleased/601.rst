    Reverted the name change of the "revisions" argument to
    :func:`.command.stamp` to "revision" as apparently applications are
    calling upon this argument as a keyword name.  Pull request courtesy
    Thomas Bechtold.  Special translations are also added to the command
    line interface so that it is still known as "revisions" in the CLI.
