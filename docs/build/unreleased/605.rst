    A major rework of the "type comparison" logic is in place which changes the
    entire approach by which column datatypes are compared.  Types are now
    compared based on the DDL string generated by the metadata type vs. the
    datatype reflected from the database.  This means we compare types based on
    what would actually render and additionally if elements of the types change
    like string length, those changes are detected as well.  False positives
    like those generated between SQLAlchemy Boolean and MySQL TINYINT should
    also be resolved.   Thanks very much to Paul Becotte  for lots of hard work
    and patience on this one.
