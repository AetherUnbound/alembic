    Fixed regression introduced by :ticket:`579` where server default rendering
    functions began to require a dialect implementation, however the
    :func:`.render_python_code` convenience function did not include one, thus
    causing the function to fail when used in a server default context.  The
    function now accepts a migration context argument and also creates one
    against the default dialect if one is not provided.
