    Adjusted the unique constraint comparison logic in a similar manner as that
    of :ticket:`421` did for indexes in order to take into account SQLAlchemy's
    own truncation of long constraint names when a naming convention is in use.
    Without this step, a name that is truncated by SQLAlchemy based on a unique
    constraint naming convention or hardcoded name will not compare properly.
