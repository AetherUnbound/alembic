    Removed the "python setup.py test" feature in favor of a straight run of
    "tox".   Per Pypa / pytest developers, "setup.py" commands are in general
    headed towards deprecation in favor of tox.  The tox.ini script has been
    updated such that running "tox" with no arguments will perform a single run
    of the test suite against the default installed Python interpreter.
