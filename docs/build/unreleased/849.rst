    Fixed issue where dialect-specific keyword arguments within the
    :class:`.DropIndex` operation directive would not render in the
    autogenerated Python code. As support was improved for adding dialect
    specific arguments to directives as part of :ticket:`803`, in particular
    arguments such as "postgresql_concurrently" which apply to the actual
    create/drop of the index, support was needed for these to render even in a
    drop index operation. Pull request courtesy Jet Zhou.
