    Fixed bug where the double-percent logic applied to some dialects such as
    psycopg2 would be rendered in ``--sql`` mode, by allowing dialect options
    to be passed through to the dialect used to generate SQL and then providing
    ``paramstyle="named"`` so that percent signs need not be doubled.   For
    users having this issue, existing env.py scripts need to add
    ``dialect_opts={"paramstyle": "named"}`` to their offline
    context.configure().  See the ``alembic/templates/generic/env.py`` template
    for an example.
