    Fixed regression in batch mode due to :ticket:`883` where the "auto" mode
    of batch would fail to accommodate any additional migration directives
    beyond encountering an ``add_column()`` directive, due to a mis-application
    of the conditional logic that was added as part of this change, leading to
    "recreate" mode not being used in cases where it is required for SQLite
    such as for unique constraints.
