    Added new ``--purge`` flag to the ``alembic stamp`` command, which will
    unconditionally erase the version table before stamping anything.  This is
    useful for development where non-existent version identifiers might be left
    within the table.  Additionally, ``alembic.stamp`` now supports a list of
    revision identifiers, which are intended to allow setting up muliple heads
    at once.  Overall handling of version identifiers within the
    ``alembic.stamp`` command has been improved with many new tests and
    use cases added.
